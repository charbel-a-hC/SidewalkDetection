# ML-Projects
A collection of machine learning projects reflecting my progress in the Machine Learning world

My introduction to the machine learning - artificial intelligence world was sparked by BMW AG in which I'm currently undertaking my internhship. 
The specified that I was going to learn and be working on robotics and machine learning, so I hit the books and started learning. 

I come from a mechanical engineering background so coding or machine learning were not my strong-suits but I pushed through and learned some fundamentals of 
coding with a python course on Udemy. Since then, I was able to complete:

- Beirut AI bootcamp
- Python for Computer Vision on Udemy by Jose Portilla (55% complete)
- Deep Learning A-Z Hands-on Artificial Neural Networks on Udemy by Kirill Eremenko (30% complete)
- Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera wirh Andrew Ng (80% complete)
- Hands-on Machine Learning with scikit-Learn, keras and Tensorflow 2.0 (starting soon)
- Tensorflow 2.0: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence on Udemy (starting soon)
- deeplearning.ai Tensorflow developer on coursera with Andrew Ng (starting soon)

Projects completed: 

- Scattered beginner projects with no documentation as introduction to the field
- Object Detection using DetectNet with BMW AG
- 3D pose estimation using PoseCNN with BMW AG

The reason I created this github repository is to document my projects as I progress in this interesting field.
