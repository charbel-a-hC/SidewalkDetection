# ML-Projects
A collection of machine learning projects reflecting my progress in the Machine Learning world


## Project Ideas

- Classifier (cat vs dog maybe, something simple) implemented training loop in ISAAC and use TensorRT for inference (dockerize app)
- Create Object detection model, (custom YOLO on object of choice), implement inference on FastAPI and dockerize the app (something similar to BMW innovation lab yolo inference app)
- Tensorflow Lite, create an AI model and deploy on Raspberry PI or Android Phone (samsung)
- Reinforcement Learning Game
- Try to initiate FYP Project Control system (6 axis robot arm control using ISAAC)(take some inspiration from the idealapp)
